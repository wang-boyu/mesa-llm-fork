Mesa-LLM integrates large language models (LLMs) as decision-making agents into the Mesa agent-based modeling (ABM) framework. It enables sophisticated, language-driven agent behaviors, allowing researchers to model scenarios involving communication, negotiation, and decision-making influenced by natural language.
