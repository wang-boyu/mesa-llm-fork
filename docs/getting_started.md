# Getting Started
Mesa-LLM is an extension of the Mesa agent-based modeling framework that enables language-model-based reasoning inside agents, while preserving Mesa’s execution model, scheduling, and environments.

Mesa-LLM allows agents to reason using natural language prompts, enabling more flexible, interpretable, and adaptive decision-making within structured simulations.

Agents in Mesa-LLM are still standard Mesa agents. The only difference is how decisions are made, not how models run.

## Overview
If you want a high-level understanding of Mesa-LLM structure and capabilities, start here:
- [Overview of Mesa-LLM Library](overview.md)

## Tutorials
If you want to learn Mesa-LLM step by step, follow these tutorials:
- [Creating your First Mesa-LLM Model](tutorials/first_model.md)
Learn how to define a minimal LLMAgent that reasons using an LLM while remaining a standard Mesa agent.

- [Negotiation Model Tutorial](tutorials/negotiation_model_tutorial.md)
Learn how multiple LLM-powered agents reason, communicate, and negotiate within a shared model.

## Examples
Mesa-LLM ships with example models demonstrating how language-based reasoning integrates with classic agent-based modeling patterns.

These examples are useful if you are already familiar with Mesa and want to see how LLM-powered agents behave in practice. You can find them here:
